      <h1>Magenta</h1>
      <p>
        Unlike its close cousin red, magenta isn't a spectral color - you won't
        find it in a natural rainbow. Magenta earned its place in printing
        because it's the most efficient single pigment for absorbing green light
        while reflecting both red and blue. Magenta's unique properties make it
        irreplaceable - no other single pigment can achieve the same selective
        absorption pattern. Alternative red pigments either absorb too much blue
        light or not enough green light to serve as an effective primary color.
        In modern printing, magenta ink uses quinacridone or xanthene-based
        pigments that absorb green light while reflecting both red and blue
        wavelengths.

        Originally named "fuchsine" after the fuchsia flower, this color got its
        modern name from the Battle of Magenta in 1859 - the same year a new
        aniline dye was created in this distinctive shade.
