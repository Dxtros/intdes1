      <p>
        Cyan was selected as a primary printing color because it's the most
        effective single pigment for absorbing red light while reflecting both
        blue and green wavelengths. Its absorption spectrum is remarkably clean,
        with minimal unwanted absorption in other parts of the spectrum. This
        selective absorption makes it ideal for subtractive color mixing - when
        layered with other inks, it maintains high saturation without creating
        muddy colors. Its molecular structure also allows for stable pigment
        formulations that resist fading.

        Modern cyan inks are typically copper-based phthalocyanine pigments,
        chosen for their excellent lightfastness and intensity. The ancient
        Greeks called this color "kuanos," originally referring to dark blue
        enamel work, though modern process cyan is standardized at much brighter
        values.
